🔍 ##Project Insight: SQLite Sales Summary using Python
In this project, I developed a Python-based solution to connect, query, and analyze sales data stored in a SQLite database. The goal was to automate the process of generating summary reports from transactional data.

🧠 ##Key Insights:
Used SQLite and Python (sqlite3 module) to manage and query sales data efficiently.

Extracted and summarized key business metrics such as total revenue, product-wise sales, and region-wise performance.

Demonstrated the use of parameterized queries and data validation to ensure accurate and secure data handling.

Presented the results in a clean, readable format for further use in dashboards or reports.

This notebook showcases my ability to integrate databases with Python for real-world data analysis—an essential skill in building data-driven applications.
